To determine why tests are not running, these steps are useful:

    Verify that all files with test cases start with 'test_' word.
    Verify that all test cases names also start with 'test_' word.
    Verify that you have created pytest.ini file in the root directory
    Verify that you have __init__.py file in all directories/sub-directories of the project


Pytest is not running the tests

It didn't work for you because you left "--verbosity 0" in the parameters text field. I don't know why it's not automatically erased by Eclipse, but when you change the runner you MUST also change the parameters to reflect your preferred test runner (pytest in this case).

Globally for all new configurations:

        Window -> Preferences -> PyDev -> PyUnit
        Change the test runner to "py.test runner" and clear the parameters (or add the ones you prefer. Make sure they are valid flags for pytest.)

Or, if you prefer, manually for each new run configuration

        Create a Python unittest run configuration
        Select the class you want to run and the project (if they are not already there)
        In the Arguments tab override the pyUnit preferences with a py.test runner (clean up the parameters and add whatever you want to add to pytest flags)
