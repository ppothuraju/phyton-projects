'''
The last group consists of some general-purpose functions like:

    ceil(x) → the ceiling of x (the smallest integer greater than or equal to x)
    floor(x) → the floor of x (the largest integer less than or equal to x)
    trunc(x) → the value of x truncated to an integer (be careful - it's not an equivalent either of ceil or floor)
    factorial(x) → returns x! (x has to be an integral and not a negative)
    hypot(x, y) → returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle with the leg lengths equal to x and y (the same as sqrt(pow(x, 2) + pow(y, 2)) but more precise)
